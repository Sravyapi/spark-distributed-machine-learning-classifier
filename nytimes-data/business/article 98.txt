Supported by By John Koblin Three months after departing the Amazon series “Transparent” amid accusations of sexual harassment, the actor Jeffrey Tambor is poised to return to television. Mr. Tambor, who left his Emmy-winning role on “Transparent” after being accused of harassment by a fellow cast member and a former assistant, will appear regularly during the forthcoming season of “Arrested Development” on Netflix, according to a spokesman for 20th Century Fox Television, the studio behind the show. The season, the show’s fifth, was filmed last year, before the allegations were made against Mr. Tambor, the spokesman said. It is not clear if there were any discussions about pulling Mr. Tambor from the show or not using the scenes in which he appeared. A Netflix spokeswoman did not immediately respond to inquiries. Mr. Tambor plays the patriarch of the Bluth family, the dysfunctional clan at the center of the show. Last year, Netflix fired Kevin Spacey from “House of Cards” after he faced numerous allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. The next and final season of “House of Cards” will appear later this year, without Mr. Spacey. A premiere date for the new season of “Arrested Development” has not been announced. But Mitchell Hurwitz, the creator of the show, said this week that the return would be “real soon.” The first three seasons of the series, which was a critical hit and beloved by its fans but struggled to find an audience, aired on Fox between 2003 and 2006. The fourth season appeared on Netflix in 2013. Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
