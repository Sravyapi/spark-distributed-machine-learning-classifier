Supported by Front Burner By Florence Fabricant In France it’s not pudding, it’s pot de crème (poe duh KREM). And for the past few years, the French pastry chef Maxime Pouvreau has been making pots de crème in San Francisco in a handful of flavors sold on the West Coast. Now, having recently expanded his business, he is offering them online and in stores from West to East. The brand is Petit Pot in single-serving 3.5-ounce glass jars. Vanilla, salted caramel, lemon curd and intense dark chocolate are the flavors. There is also creamy rice pudding, riz au lait, and a nondairy version, riz au lait coco. All are kosher: Petit Pot, $39.99 for eight including shipping, petitpot.com, about $3.50 a jar retail. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
