data security increasing every day arguing question security versus security rather security versus privacy proposals involve giving keys customers device data anyone customer inject new dangerous weaknesses product security said statement weakening security makes sense consider customers rely products keep personal information safe run businesses even manage vital infrastructure like power grids transportation systems computer security researchers believe problem might solvable acceptable level new risks national academy sciences committee completed month study encryption debate publishing report last month largely described challenges solving problem one section cited presentations several technologists developing potential approaches included ray ozzie former chief software

come solutions going dark problem symphony approach however would work millions ordinary smartphone users one alternative worked mr ozzie others receiving particular attention inside government idea devices encrypt would generate special access key could unlock data without owner passcode electronic key would stored device inside part hard drive would separately encrypted manufacturer response court order could open law enforcement officials see idea attractive part companies like apple already trusted securely hold special keys permitting push operating system updates devices like iphones still ms landau argued creating system would create significant additional security risks noted among things updates relatively rare police would want seized phones opened every day many tech company employees would need access powerful new keys increasing risk theft abuse obama administration never agreed asking legislation mandating access mechanisms military cybersecurity agencies worried weakening security would create new problems commerce officials worried quashing innovation making american tech products less competitive still obama administration deliberations also came focus idea
