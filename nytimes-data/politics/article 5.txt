Supported by By Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON â€” A person with a weapon was arrested Wednesday at a building that houses several foreign consular offices in Northwest Washington, Secret Service officials said. About 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, Secret Service officials responded to reports of gunfire in a neighborhood that hosts restaurants, hotels, apartments and some diplomatic offices. Law enforcement officers determined that no shots had been fired, but they arrested and charged an armed person with assault, officials said. Metropolitan Police in Washington are now handling the arrest, and Secret Service officials declined to comment further on the incident, citing an ongoing investigation. It was unclear whether the person was in or just near the building, why the person was there and whether any specific foreign office might have been a target. Officials declined to say whether the person was intentionally near the foreign offices, or was unaware of their location. The building houses several foreign consular offices, including for Mexico and India, as well as the Interest Section for Iran, which is hosted by the Pakistani Embassy. The Interest Section, which exists in lieu of a formal Iranian embassy, serves as the de facto consulate to handle visa requests, travel questions and general information for Iranian citizens in the United States.
