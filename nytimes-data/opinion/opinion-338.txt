supported ross douthat since parkland shootings florida senator marco rubio done many things liberals say desperate desperate decent republicans changed position gun control expressing support new restrictions age limits gun purchases new background check rules possibly magazine restrictions co sponsored legislation encouraging states issue restraining orders temporarily would strip people deemed dangerous guns measures conservative support cases florida republican effectively bucked n r period rubio prominent republican vigorously sometimes virulently attacked student led movement filled c protesters last weekend showed cnn town hall met boos heckles one shooting survivors told looking like staring barrel assault rifle notwithstanding subsequent policy concessions march lives students wore price tags around neck amount money rubio campaigns received n r divided number students florida schools david hogg one leaders began speech price tag line told cnn interviewer anything feels attacks florida senator provocative enough time many years ago rubio attacked efforts bipartisanship regarded skeptically liberals perceived threat plausible eloquent leader less bunkered g p bridge party old white base multicultural america time passed least rubio defeated partially undone donald trump especially turned nevertrump card filmed hostage video endorsement official media consensus florida senator flipped great republican hope liddle marco anti rubio sentiment became dominated less anxiety contempt contempt seems inform reaction every public utterance since parkland think anti rubio zeal student activists also picking general approach politics trump era encouraged among liberals view since current republican majorities forged anger kind smash mouth politics incumbent upon liberals give quarter return treat sudden conciliation prominent figure like florida senator opportunity deal making welcome sign weakness inspire fierce attack theory certain logic yes anti gun activists spent less time screaming rubio efforts might open little common ground gun policy rubio one senator previous pushes gun regulation republican senatorial sponsors dying filibuster liberals broadly favorable efforts rubio deliver immigration reform republican house problem relying bipartisan impulses republican politicians need broader climate change path change requires first putting fear god prefer fear arc history vulnerable republican lawmakers making unpopular enough simply beat rage rubio could argued good example two approaches reinforce far experience screamed made repudiate support new gun measures perhaps indeed helped concentrate mind political reasons support providing example activists states use shame republican representatives ties n r meanwhile rubio approval rating florida exactly great next election long way precisely kind republican needs defeated build democratic supermajority chance make face g p intransigence gun control even actually face intransigence moment opportunity important missed deeper logic plausible mission democrats trumpian takeover g p kind carthaginian peace delenda est grand old party different world maybe could make deals republican like rubio world g p work clearly one forcing table ultimately means real goal eventual defeat want wring hands attitude corrosive effect politics seems conservatism surrendered donald trump arguments corrosion became bit irrelevant rubio politics handle vehement attacks president florida senator endorsed consistently ad hominem young school shooting survivors rather less excuse things risk lose fight way rubio critics seem want fight instance one reason dreamer amnesty executive decision donald trump could simply reverse landing us current immigration stalemate obama white house deliberately chose make one pre empting effort yes marco rubio craft bipartisan legislation good example smash mouth liberalism albeit substantive case rather rhetorical driven fear rubio rather current spirit contempt let republican politician make nice latino voters let republicans disguise anti immigrant views modest bipartisan maneuvers create clear contrast voters reward even requires pushing certain constitutional limits power work particularly well indeed anything obama executive action contributed trump victory helping radicalize conservative voters several years later dreamer cohort back limbo executive move lacked bipartisan support legislative form maybe longer run whole debate help smash g p liberals believe deserves smashed yet another example one trump era debate republican tax bill marco rubio made extended effort move bill middle class friendly direction adding enlarging child tax credit push opposed many republican colleagues time rubio thought could get amendment senate democrat support end presumably grounds modestly improving republican bill makes harder attack later nine senate democrats voted rubio proposal went easy defeat maybe example tough liberals brilliantly playing hardball let rubio kind victory slightly popular flavor republicanism party easier crush beyond interim meant senate democrats gave chance move real world public policy direction many support order pursue yet hypothetical larger victory may like hillary clinton presidency actually materialize soon say whether dynamic repeat post parkland gun control debate activists anti rubio zeal might actually help progress legislation holding newfound promises might point making deal unless willing accept something closer full list activist demands bargain sort might possible long republicans hold senate even long hold seats states like florida case hate senator necessary path eventual retirement personally agnostic points various bipartisan efforts true rubio proven actually deliver votes major compromises watched trump g p hold power largely negative agenda ugly rhetorical style certainly believe quarter liberalism gain power eventually turn also believe obvious pleasure found demonizing republican likely outreach could deliver liberalism already earning last years satisfaction self righteousness compensation absence political policy success
