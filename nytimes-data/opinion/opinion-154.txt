research suggests additives extend shelf life improve texture foods may unintended side effects bodies directly human microbiome trillions bacteria living guts substances may selectively feed dangerous members microbial communities causing illness even death consider rise deadly cases clostridium difficile c diff terrible infection gut bacterium tends strike taken antibiotics treat something else antibiotics kill native microbes allowing c diff move nearly half million people develop infection yearly according centers disease control prevention around die sometimes long bouts painful bloody diarrhea one estimate deaths linked c diff increased fivefold one reason bug become virulent evolved antibiotic resistance easily treatable years ago robert britton microbiologist baylor college medicine discovered something else c diff virulent strains outcompeting less virulent strains gut dr britton colleagues wanted know gave strains edge combed sugars amino acids present gut see microbes better utilized food source compared others results investigation recently published journal nature suggest deceptively banal adaptation two problematic c diff strains unique ability utilize sugar called trehalose trehalose occurs naturally mushrooms yeasts shellfish among things historically expensive use late new manufacturing process made sugar cheap good news companies manufactured prepackaged foods trehalose works great stabilizing processed foods keeping moist shelf improving texture since added loads everything cookies ground beef dr britton colleagues contend inadvertently cultivated toxic c diff strains driving become scourge hospitals evidence points timing recent c diff epidemics virulent strains existed cause many outbreaks large quantities trehalose entered food supply become deadly research shows people considering ecological impacts food stuffs dr britton told gut bacteria bombarded things never ate never ate concentrations eat course old mantra goes correlation prove causation trehalose probably factor behind rise epidemic c diff dr britton also found mice infected virulent strains c diff consumed sugar fared worse infected mice fed sugar research adds growing body evidence indicating common food additives push microbial communities unhealthy directions potentially aiding emergence new pathogens also encouraging diseases like obesity diabetes inflammatory bowel disease let back ask microbiome begin lug around pounds microbes gut one reason stanford university microbiologist justin sonnenburg reminded microbes rapidly shift response new foods helping us wring calories wider variety foods bodies would normally allow example pointed research microbiome people japan unique ability break seaweed scientists think acquired talent borrowing dna microbes live seaweed implication eating lots seaweed ancestral japanese pushed microbiome evolve adapted diet presumably better microbes could extract calories ate better nourishing flexibility dangerous push microbial communities far says dr sonnenburg sugary greasy diet diverges much diet humans evolved eating others think microbes westernized populations may longer mesh well human body gut microbes kept slightly removed intestinal lining thin layer mucus western diet seems erode protective barrier bringing microbes close diet rich soluble fiber hand keeps mucus barrier thick healthy certain food additives also lead weakened mucus barrier andrew gewirtz microbiologist georgia state university colleagues found common emulsifiers polysorbate carboxymethylcellulose often found items like mayonnaise ice cream prompt erosion mucus barrier mice also seem cause mice microbes produce proteins inflame gut increasing animals tendency toward obesity diabetes christine mcdonald scientist cleveland clinic discovered something similar food thickener maltodextrin seems thin mucus barrier mice nourish strain e coli linked crohn disease inflammatory bowel disease microbiomes patients crohn found enhanced ability break maltodextrin compared people without disease suggesting germs potentially driving disease profit maltodextrin prevalence inflammatory bowel disease worth noting sharply increased recent decades artificial sweeteners like sucralose saccharin consume diet sodas sugar free snacks hopes cutting calories bodies directly digest meant pass right turns microbes inhabiting colons metabolize sweeteners potentially detriment scientists weizmann institute science israel found mice saccharin causes glucose intolerance marker impending diabetes one disease eat sweeteners probably trying avoid scientists transplanted microbes mice fed saccharine mice consumed sweetener recipient animals developed glucose intolerance well suggesting microbiome warped sweetener sweetener causing problems scientists also fed small group healthy people saccharin sweetened drinks week subset volunteers microbial shifts occurred accompanied mounting glucose intolerance people diet sodas may healthier regular sodas big question whether food additives worse high sugar high fat junk food diet often component put another way adding maltodextrin supersize ice cream smoothie really make harmful already dr britton work suggests yes additives may cause additional damage americans eating junk food long virulent c diff strains began causing havoc trehalose may tipped scales true hospitals often serve highly processed food precisely vulnerable people exposed c diff reconsider menus medicines contain thickeners artificial sweeteners stabilizers evaluated well need research see scientists observe mice also occurs people dr gewirtz beginning one study bigger problem told food drug administration organized

science still earlier stages person meantime microbiome likely shaped people animals even plants soil encounter well antibiotics take genetics among factors influences hard control control feed
