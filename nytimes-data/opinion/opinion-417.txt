supported paul krugman bad policies sometimes lead interesting economics example disastrous turn toward austerity kind natural experiment led upwelling good work effects fiscal policy starting think trumpian trade war finally seems arrived lead good work international economic policy like work fiscal policy course ignored people power still worth little essay going offer analysis numbers based chain thought begins trump evident disdain japan ends atlanta new orleans buffalo bear taste things wonkish starting point peculiar aspect trump climb steel tariffs ostensible justification tariffs national security widely noted start although probably came news trumpies u steel imports come american allies trump granted exemptions allies largely vitiate supposed point exercise one country conspicuously granted exemption however japan one answer may japanese know white another answer may trump often seems fixed ideas world long date like belief american cities gripped huge crime wave still living michael crichton era japan going take world day yet third answer may u run trade deficit japan actually even bigger headline number include japanese components embedded chinese exports trump believes trade deficit means losing someone else winning b trade balances determined protectionism propositions course untrue reality trade balances flip side capital flows countries attract inflows foreign capital outflows must sheer arithmetic run current account deficits including investment income conversely countries exporters capital run current account surpluses modern japan country really running current account surpluses one powerful reason demography japan rapidly declining working age population means limited opportunities investment means country investing savings abroad claim trade surpluses often reflect weakness trade deficits reflect strength hard sell demographic drivers trade imbalances usually lot less clear however got thinking regions within united states sharply different growth rates across metropolitan areas mainly driven migration protectionist barriers muddy picture capital surely highly mobile within country unfortunately comprehensive regional balance payments data thanks researchers brookings however lot information exports imports metropolitan areas exports imports parts u well rest world sure safe use data estimate trade balances let take stab data cover goods cover either services income transfers like say social security receipts see second make big difference think run regressions still think looking metropolitan trade balances enlightening let look metros biggest goods trade deficits surpluses first biggest deficits data billions dollars washington billion miami billion san francisco billion atlanta billion baltimore billion ok washington runs huge deficit goods basically exports garbage literally waste product runs surplus goods deficit presumably offset services federal budget stuff like payments k street lobbyists guess baltimore stuff miami meanwhile selling warm weather senior citizens live largely social security medicare big deficit surprise someone trumpist view trade balances would surely atlanta one fastest growing metropolitan areas percent increase population talking big deficit percent metro gdp answer surely deficit reflection atlanta growth talking building lots housing office parks much financed capital inflows rest country next biggest surpluses los angeles billion memphis billion greensboro billion corpus christi billion new orleans billion los angeles big metropolitan area also one whose growth slowed lot run land zoning restrictions kept building population rose percent result probably become big exporter excess savings hence city big trade surpluses around percent gdp probably even bigger data services done enough homework know going middle three know new orleans runs huge trade surpluses mean huge almost percent gdp think many people would consider new orleans economic winner fact population declined percent partly katrina also wider problems decline means savings generated new orleans go elsewhere search returns see thing smaller cities declining populations buffalo niagara falls saw percent population decline ran trade surplus percent gdp big apple greater new york ran small goods trade deficit percent gdp thanks financial industry surely ran huge surplus services remember metro area new york plenty goods exports say pharma complex new jersey big surplus economy overall growing fast despite immigration overall population growing slowly sum things within united states large regional trade imbalances reflect unfair trade policies interstate trade totally free running trade surpluses sign success running deficits sign failure anything much time reverse fast growing regions run deficits stagnating regions run surpluses principles apply international level sure experts trump administration explain president view things wrong oh wait
