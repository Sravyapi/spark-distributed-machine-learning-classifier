basis beginning genetic findings began incorporated argument year geneticist richard lewontin published important study variation protein types blood grouped human populations analyzed seven races west eurasians africans east asians south asians native americans oceanians australians found around percent variation protein types could accounted variation within populations races percent variation across extent variation among humans concluded differences individuals way consensus established among human populations differences large enough support concept biological race instead argued race social construct way categorizing people changes time across countries true race social construct also true dr lewontin wrote human populations remarkably similar genetic point view years consensus morphed seemingly without questioning orthodoxy orthodoxy maintains average genetic differences among people grouped according today racial terms trivial comes meaningful biological traits differences ignored orthodoxy goes holding anxious research genetic differences among populations concern research matter well intentioned located slippery slope leads kinds pseudoscientific arguments biological difference used past try justify slave trade eugenics movement nazis murder six million jews deep sympathy concern genetic discoveries could misused justify racism geneticist also know simply longer possible ignore average genetic differences among races groundbreaking advances dna sequencing technology made last two decades advances enable us measure exquisite accuracy fraction individual genetic ancestry traces back say west africa years ago mixing americas west african european gene pools almost completely isolated last years help tools learning race may social construct differences genetic ancestry happen correlate many today racial constructs real recent genetic studies demonstrated differences across populations genetic determinants simple traits skin color also complex traits like bodily dimensions susceptibility diseases example know genetic factors help explain northern europeans taller average southern europeans multiple sclerosis common european americans african americans reverse true end stage kidney disease worried well meaning people deny possibility substantial biological differences among human populations digging indefensible position one survive onslaught science also worried whatever discoveries made truly idea yet cited scientific proof racist prejudices agendas correct along well meaning people understand science well enough push back claims important even urgent develop candid scientifically date way discussing differences instead sticking heads sand caught unprepared found get sense modern genetic research average biological differences across populations looks like consider example work beginning around began exploring whether population mixture occurred last hundred years americas could leveraged find risk factors prostate cancer disease occurs times often self identified african americans self identified european americans disparity possible explain based dietary environmental differences suggesting genetic factors might play role self identified african americans turn derive average percent genetic ancestry enslaved africans brought america th th centuries colleagues searched african american men prostate cancer locations genome fraction genes contributed west african ancestors larger elsewhere genome found exactly looking location genome percent african ancestry average looked detail found region contained least seven independent risk factors prostate cancer common west africans findings could fully account higher rate prostate cancer african americans european americans could conclude african americans happen entirely european ancestry small section genomes risk prostate cancer random europeans research rely terms like african american european american socially constructed label segments genome probably west african european origin yes research identify real risk factors disease differ frequency across populations leading discoveries potential improve health save lives yes people agree finding genetic explanation elevated rate disease important often draw line finding genetic influences propensity disease one thing argue looking influences behavior cognition another whether like line already crossed recent study led economist daniel benjamin compiled information number years education people almost european ancestry controlling differences socioeconomic background colleagues identified genetic variations represented genes known important neurological development incontrovertibly common europeans years education europeans fewer years education yet clear genetic variations operate follow study icelanders led geneticist augustine kong showed genetic variations also nudge people carry delay children variations may explaining longer times school affecting behavior nothing intelligence study joined others finding genetic predictors behavior one led geneticist danielle posthuma studied people found genetic variations genes predictive performance intelligence tests performance intelligence test number years school person attends shaped way person brought course measure something aspect behavior cognition almost certainly since traits influenced genetics expected differ across populations frequencies genetic variations rarely exactly across populations genetic influences behavior cognition differ across populations sometimes hear biological differences among populations likely small humans diverged recently common ancestors substantial differences arisen pressure natural selection true ancestors east asians europeans west africans australians recently almost completely isolated one another years longer sufficient time forces evolution work indeed study led dr kong showed iceland measurable genetic selection genetic variations predict years education population within last century understand dangerous geneticists anthropologists simply repeat old consensus human population differences consider kinds voices filling void silence creating nicholas wade longtime science journalist new york times rightly notes book troublesome inheritance genes race human history modern research challenging thinking nature human population differences goes make unfounded irresponsible claim research suggesting genetic factors explain traditional stereotypes one mr wade key sources example anthropologist henry harpending asserted people sub saharan african ancestry propensity work claims go type natural selection hard work last thousands years eurasians simply scientific evidence support statement indeed geneticists including pointed letter new york times mr wade book genetic evidence back racist stereotypes promotes another high profile example james watson scientist co discovered structure dna forced retire head cold spring harbor laboratories stated interview without scientific evidence research suggested genetic factors contribute lower intelligence africans europeans meeting years later dr watson said fellow geneticist beth shapiro something effect guys going figure jews much smarter everyone else asserted jews high achievers genetic advantages conferred thousands years natural selection scholars east asian students tended conformist selection conformity ancient chinese society contacted recently dr watson denied made statements maintaining represent views dr shapiro said recollection matched mine makes dr watson mr wade statements insidious start accurate observation many academics implausibly denying possibility average genetic differences among human populations end claim backed evidence know differences correspond racist stereotypes use reluctance academic community openly discuss fraught issues provide rhetorical cover hateful ideas old racist canards knowledgeable scientists must speak abstain laying rational framework discussing differences among populations risk losing trust public actively contribute distrust expertise prevalent leave vacuum gets filled pseudoscience outcome far worse anything could achieve talking openly scientists confident anything whatever currently believe genetic nature differences among populations likely wrong example laboratory discovered based sequencing ancient human genomes whites derived population existed time immemorial people believe instead whites represent mixture four ancient populations lived years ago different one another europeans east asians today prepare likelihood coming years genetic studies show many traits influenced genetic variations traits differ average across human populations impossible indeed anti scientific foolish absurd deny differences natural response challenge learn example biological differences exist males females differences sexes far profound exist among human populations reflecting million years evolution adaptation males females differ huge tracts genetic material chromosome males females second x chromosome females males everyone accepts biological differences males females profound addition anatomical differences men women exhibit average differences size physical strength also average differences temperament behavior though important unresolved questions extent differences influenced social expectations upbringing accommodate biological differences men women think answer obvious recognize genetic differences males females exist accord sex freedoms opportunities regardless differences clear inequities persist women men society fulfilling aspirations practice challenge yet conceptually straightforward case men women surely case whatever differences may find among human populations great majority far less profound abiding challenge civilization treat human individual empower people regardless hand dealt deck life compared enormous differences exist among individuals differences among populations average many times smaller modest challenge accommodate reality average genetic contributions human traits differ important face whatever science reveal without prejudging outcome confidence mature enough handle findings arguing substantial differences among human populations possible invite racist misuse
