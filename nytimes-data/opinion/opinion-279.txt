intellectual environment shifts properly prepare discussion nathan san marcos calif point view possible everyone hold heads following six truths race fundamentally social category biological one anthropologists shown clear genetic contributors many traits including behavior present day human populations often always correlated today race categories number instances largely isolated one another tens thousands years long separations provided adequate opportunity frequencies genetic variations change genetic variations likely affect behavior cognition affect traits even though know average genetic influences behavior cognition strongly affected upbringing likely modest genetic influences bodily traits disease genetic variations influence behavior one population almost certainly effect behavior others populations even ways genetic variations manifest population may different given genetically determined traits differ somewhat among populations expect differences average effects including traits like behavior insist meaningful average differences among human populations possible harmful perceived misleading even patronizing general public encourages people trust honesty scholars instead embrace theories scientifically grounded often racist short think everyone understand modest differences across human population genetic influences behavior cognition expected think everyone understand even yet idea difference need worried find already sure differences small far smaller among individuals society already committed giving everyone full opportunity self realization regardless particular hand person dealt deck life since already committed accommodating slight differences average genetic influences traits might eventually found little extra work handle
