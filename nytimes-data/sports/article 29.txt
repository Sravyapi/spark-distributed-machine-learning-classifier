Supported by By The Associated Press MADRID — Top-ranked Rafael Nadal lost to Dominic Thiem, 7-5, 6-3, in the Madrid Open quarterfinals on Friday, breaking the defending champion’s run of 21 consecutive wins on clay courts. Nadal had not lost a single set on clay since falling to Thiem at the Rome Open quarterfinals one year ago. Since that loss, Nadal had been impeccable on his preferred surface. He had won the French Open and the hardcourt United States Open to take his Grand Slam haul to 16, and he came to the Spanish capital fresh off winning his 11th titles at both Monte Carlo and Barcelona. But Thiem beat Nadal at his own game, finishing long rallies with winners and avoiding the costly hitting errors that sank Nadal’s title defense. Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
